During our first introductory meeting, we discussed a challenge they were facing with learning blind kids how to swim. Fear of hitting the pool-wall forces blind children to swim with one arm outstretched or raised, making progress slow. And even those children that could already swim, could not do so independently when swimming ‘at-speed&rsquo;. A coach or trainer has to be with them constantly to prevent injury by hitting the wall, putting these children at a disadvantage when swimming.&nbsp;<br><br>I started dreaming about a solution that was both easy enough to install without technical knowledge, that could be deployed without prohibitive costs, and on top was reliable enough to earn the trust of the kids.&nbsp;<br><br>A small team - one developer, one UX Designer and me - started to work...</p></div><div class="col-md-6 order-md-1"><img src="../img/lazyload-ph.png" data-src="../img/swimming%20pool.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block img-swimming-pool-style mg-sm lazyload" alt="swimming%20pool" /></div></div></div></div><!-- bloc-4 END --><!-- bloc-4 --><div class="bloc tc-cool-grey" id="bloc-4"><div class="container bloc-lg"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6 align-self-center"><h2 class="mg-md tc-black text-lg-start">Hill Statement</h2><p class="text-lg-center hs-top mg-clear">Sandra, a young blind swimmer that loves to be in the swimming pool<br></p><p class="text-lg-center hs-middle mg-clear">can swim and turn by herself<br></p><p class="text-lg-center hs-bottom mg-clear">without an<span></span>y assistance from a coach or person<br></p><p class="mg-md tc-3823 text-justify btn-resize-mode p-bloc-4-style"><br>To quickly convey the idea of the solution, we used the Hill Statement from the IBM Design Thinking methodology.
